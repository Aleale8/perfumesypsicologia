Fragrances are composed of volatile compounds **(less than 300 Da)** that stimulate the olfactory system, triggering electrical signals via olfactory receptors connected to the brain\u2019s limbic system, which governs emotion, memory, and behavior. Scientific research shows that inhaling specific aromas can alter mood, stress levels, cognitive performance, and physiological parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate. EEG studies have demonstrated that fragrance exposure can modify brain wave patterns\u2014where increased alpha and beta waves are linked to relaxation and alertness, while excess theta and delta waves suggest cognitive decline or fatigue. Fragrance components, especially essential oils extracted from over **17,000** aromatic plant species, mainly consist of terpenes and aromatic compounds with therapeutic effects. These bioactive molecules, like linalool, citronellol, and geraniol, are used widely in aromatherapy and cosmetic industries for their physical and mental health benefits. Historically rooted in ancient civilizations like Egypt, China, and India, aromatherapy continues to grow in medical and wellness applications today. Overall, this review emphasizes that olfactory stimulation through fragrance inhalation has measurable effects on brain activity and can be a potential natural approach for enhancing mental well-being, reducing stress, and supporting cognitive health.\n"}
